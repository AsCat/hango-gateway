** DO NOT OPEN NEW ISSUES ON THIS REPOSITORY **

This repository has not been marked archived/read-only, as we do periodically
update the list of packages and/or their constraints. However, this repository
is a _metapackage_, and is only used to release the product.

If you find an issue, you should determine which package is responsible, and
report against the correct package repository. As an example, if you see an
exception reported that mentions `data plane`, this indicates an issue with 
the `Envoy` package, and should be reported against the `Envoy` repository.

In the majority of cases, we will close any new issues without comment.
