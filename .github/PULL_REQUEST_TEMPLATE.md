** DO NOT OPEN NEW PULL REQUESTS AGAINST THIS REPOSITORY **

This repository has not been marked archived/read-only, as we do periodically update the list of packages and/or their constraints. However, this repository is a metapackage, and is only used to release the product.

Only open a pull request that will update existing package constraints; all other requests will be closed.
